# LLM Fine-Tuning Experiments
Through experimenting with the foundation model, we found that the LLM sometimes struggled to provide playlist recommendations with prompts containing slang and prompts that do not explicitly ask for a playlist. Furthermore, the formatting of the responses had high variability and playlists for different prompts often still included similar songs. Thus the goal of fine-tuning was to improve the LLM's responses to slang and vague prompts, improve the quality of the song recommendations, and improve the consistency in formatting and tone in the responses.

## Using the Spotify playlist dataset
First, we experimented with fine-tuning the LLM on the Prompt-Playlist pair dataset generated from the Spotify playlist data. This data consists of 50 prompt-playlist pairs where the playlist content consists of real user-generated playlists, and the prompt is LLM-generated based on the user-generated title and description. 
Here is a sample from the dataset:
![datav1](../images/datav1.png)

The LLM was fine-tuned using `adapter size=4`, `learning_rate_multiplier=1`, for 3 epochs and 10 epochs, and the tuning metrics from GCP are displayed here:
| Number of Epochs  | Tuning Metrics   |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 3 |![trainv1](../images/trainv1_3epoch.png)|
| 10 | ![trainv1.1](../images/trainv1_10epoch.png)|

Through examination of the tuning metrics, the lack of improvement in the training loss with 3 epochs suggested that 3 epochs was insufficient in improving the model. Preliminary chats with the 3 epoch fine-tuned model further proved this point as the fine-tuned model had essentially the same responses as the foundation model. 

Therefore, only the 10 epoch fine-tuned model was considered for subsequent model comparisons. 


## Using the LLM-generated dataset
Next, we experimented with fine-tuning on LLM-generated Prompt-Playlist data. This data consists of 68 prompt-playlist pairs where both the prompt and responses were LLM-generated using specific instructions. Here is a sample from the dataset:
![datav2](../images/datav2.png)

The LLM was fine-tuned using `adapter size=4`, `learning_rate_multiplier=1`, for 3, 10 and 15 epochs, and the tuning metrics from GCP are displayed here:
| Number of Epochs  | Tuning Metrics   |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 3 |![trainv1](../images/trainv2_3epoch.png)|
| 10 | ![trainv1.1](../images/trainv2_10epoch.png)|
| 15 | ![trainv1.1](../images/trainv2_15epoch.png) |

Similar to the Spotify-generated data fine-tuning, it appears that 3 epochs was insufficient in improving the model based on the training loss logs. Again, preliminary chats with the 3 epoch model supported this conclusion as the fine-tune model responses were very similar to the foundation model. Thus we only included the 10 epoch and 15 epoch models for model comparisons.

Based on this initial comparison, the 10 epoch fine-tuned models, both with Spotify data and LLM-generated data seem to have the optimal responses in terms of tone and response formatting. The 15 epoch model response seems overly brief, with a lack of explanation for the playlist content, potentially suggesting overfitting that led to suboptimal outputs. We further compare the responses between the two 10 epoch models using a prompt with slang:

Let's go!" 

Examining the responses for this prompt and other prompts in the spreadsheet, while it can be subjective, we found that the model fine-tuned with the LLM-generated data provided better quality song recommendations that match the prompt request. For example, the song "Strange Fruit" in the Spotify data fine-tuned model is a jazz/blues song, which does not match the request for an empowering playlist. One explanation for this could be that the Spotify data with user-generated playlists may have contained playlists with wide mixes of music categories that do not perfectly correspond to their titles/descriptions, potentially blurring the model's ability to categorize and select relevant songs. Therefore, thus far in the experimentation, we determine that the model fine-tuned on LLM-generated prompt-playlist pairs for 10 epochs is our best model. 

With this final model, we also experimented with the temperature in the configurations, trying values 0.75, 1.2, and 1.7. However, we did not see any significant differences in the responses after changing this parameter.

In terms of continued experimentation, we may consider using a larger sized dataset and expanding the types of prompts to target other areas of improvement, so the model has a more diverse set of training examples to learn from.
