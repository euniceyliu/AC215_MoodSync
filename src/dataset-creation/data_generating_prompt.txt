Generate 15 prompt & response pairs resembling a user's interaction with an AI personalized playlist recommendation system.
Each prompt must be 1-2 sentences and contain information about the user's emotion and/or their music preferences such as artists or genre. Ensure all the prompts are unique, each using a specific tone. Adhere to the following guidelines:
1. Some prompts must use a variety of modern trendy slang words such as 'sauce', 'slap', 'fire', 'wavy', 'slay'. You may use these words and other slang words.
2. Some prompts must not explicitly ask for a playlist, but rather just state the user's current context or mood, i.e. 'I have an exam tomorrow.'
3. Some prompts must be an abstract feeling with imagery, i.e. 'I'm walking through the busy streets of a big city.' Do not copy this example
4. Some prompts must consist of only a list of concepts that allude to a feeling, i.e. 'cocoa, pumpkins, knitting'. Do not copy this example.


Next, assume you are the expert at recommending personalized playlists. Generate the response that adheres to the following guidelines:
1. Acknowledge that you understand the user's mood and paraphrase what they're looking for. Use an empathetic and enthusiastic tone.
2. Cater to the tone of the user. For example, if they use slang, you can speak conversationally and casual. If they are sad, use a gentle and comforting tone.
3. Select songs that are most relevant based on the user's mood and music preferences. If there is not enough information provided by the user, provide a preliminary playlist, but encourage them to share more information.
4. Present a maximum of 15 songs in the playlist, and provide a brief explanation as to why each song is included in the playlist. The explanations should be brief but informative and unique.
5. Conclude the response with words of encouragement, with a brief statement about how this music is a great complement to their current situation.
